.. _RefNatlinkEngine:

Natlink and DNS engine back-end
============================================================================

Dragonfly uses Natlink to communicate with Dragon.  The latest versions of
Natlink are available from `SourceForge
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlinktest4.1/>`__.

Dragonfly and Natlink support Dragon versions up to 15 (latest). The
*Individual* editions of *Dragon* are recommended, although other editions
such as *Home* will also work.

Once Natlink is up and running, Dragonfly command-modules can be
treated as any other Natlink macro files.  Natlink automatically
loads macro files from a predefined directory.  Common locations
are:

 * ``C:\Program Files\NatLink\MacroSystem``
 * ``My Documents\Natlink``

At least one of these should be present after installing
Natlink.  That is the place where you should put Dragonfly
command-modules so that Natlink will load them.  Don't forget to
turn the microphone off and on again after placing a new
command-modules in the Natlink directory, because otherwise
Natlink does not immediately see the new file.


Engine Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine can be configured by passing (optional) keyword arguments to
the ``get_engine()`` function, which passes them to the engine constructor
(documented below). For example:

.. code:: Python

   engine = get_engine("natlink",
     retain_dir="natlink_recordings",
   )

The engine can also be configured via the :ref:`command-line interface
<RefCLI>`:

.. code:: shell

   # Initialize the Natlink engine back-end with custom arguments, then load
   # command modules and recognize speech.
   python -m dragonfly load _*.py --engine natlink --engine-options \
       retain_dir="natlink_recordings"
