"""
This script installs a development link to the Dragonfly
source directory into the local Python distribution.

This is useful for Dragonfly developers, because it lets
them have a working copy checked out from the Dragonfly
repository somewhere, and at the same time have that copy
directly accessible through ``import dragonfly``.
